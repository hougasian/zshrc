# .zshrc

macOS 10.15 Catalina introduced zsh as the new default shell. The MacBook Pro I had at that time didn't have zshell's native configuration file .zshrc, so i had to add from a [template file](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/templates/zshrc.zsh-template).

After purchasing an [Apple Silicon](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/) MBA, i realized that the rc config file just isn't there ðŸ˜” (it's here ðŸ˜œ)

> UPDATE: New M1 MBP running macOS Monterey 12.2.1 no longer needs the template file above. Try just using the `curl` or `wget` below first. 

## wget/curl

```
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hougasian/zshrc/main/.zshrc
```
```
wget --no-check-certificate --content-disposition https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hougasian/zshrc/main/.zshrc
```
